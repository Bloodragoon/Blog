<p style="font-size:100%;">
My first Unreal 4 project, an architectural visualization of a living room space in a high rise apartment building. My goals for this project was getting into grips with using Unreal Engine 4 and exploring creating environments.
</p>
<p>
This project was my adaptation of the first segment in the Udemy course by Christopher Murphy. The scene consists of a mixture of course assets and Epic Games assets.
</p><br />

<p><br />
I started out by defining the workspace for the scene. To do this I used BSP geometry for the walls and floors. Followed by adding in a few static meshes to help scope out the scale and proportions of the design.
<p><br />

<p style="text-align: center; font-size:85%;"><i>

<p><br />
At this point, it was clear I needed to start re-defining the room size to better accommodate the scale of the design. I also added in temporary lighting to help make working in the scene easier.
<p><br />

<p><br />
Now that the room was looking in better shape I began filling out the room with more detail. Adding more static meshes as well as adding materials to the BSP surfaces.
<p><br />

<p style="text-align: center; font-size:85%;"><i>

<p><br />
I was finding the design was looking and not feeling like a home, so I added in more details and imperfections (such as messy bookshelves and tables) to make it as if through someone lives in the space. Changing some of the surface materials and adding in baloney also helped improve the overall warmth to the room.
<p><br />

<p><br />
Something was missing that made the room still feel too clean. I decided to add in the illusion of an additional room to enhance the vision that this room belongs to an entire appartment. This became the final scene design before working on lighting.
<p><br />

<p style="text-align: center; font-size:85%;"><i>

Next was lighting, where I could finally remove temporary construction lights in for production lighting. The idea here was to enhance the ranchsliders sunlight as much as possible, making it a core feature of the design, but not too overpowering. Lighting is tricky and I continued to modify it throughout the project.
<p><br />

<p><br />
Following lighting was post-processing. To me, this part feels like 'glueing' all the individual elements together - the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. I had a lot of fun with post-processing, but again with lighting its something that I was forever tweaking and modifying. Post-processing really helped to bring out the warmth in the room, enhancing the natural sunlight coming through.

<p><br />
The final part was adding in particles. In this case, I added a dust particle system to help improve the homely feel to space - help make the room not feel so sterile.

<b>Conclusion and Critique</b><br /><br />
Overall I am happy with the way the project came together. I learnt a lot about the process of building up a scene and each of the elements required at each step. I will admit the lighting and post-processing still needs work. I was struggling a bit with lighting strength and intensity. Where it is looking like it has too much contrast in areas. Some of the assets I overused in places, making the design feel less desirable - could combat this by using more assets or creating variations of existing assets.
