I was beginning to really like building game environments. The cavern taught me a lot of new skills and inspired me to work straight into a new scene. So I started browsing through the Epic market place for assets which could excite me for a new scene. I came across Epic Game's 'Infinity Blade: Ice Lands' asset pack and the project took off from there.
<p>
</p>
My goals for this project was to try to expand my experience using Unreal Engine as well as development game environment skills. Trying out a bigger scene appealed to me in achieving both of these goals.

Like with all my scene, I start out by defining the workspace. I learn from the previous project that I don't always need to start off using BSP.  I found the assets alone to be sufficient in building out a decent size scene.
</p>
<p>
I began with the cliff size and positioning. I had ideas of a series of cliffs bundled together with a village nested atop. I threw in some basic static meshes to help define the space in regards to the overall proportion.
</p><br />

I felt the scene size was working quite well at this point with a good scale. It was much larger than previous projects but manageable as I could break down the scene into areas.
<p>
</p>
Placing in meshes and building out the scene was a lot of fun. Figuring out creative ways of how this village might have come together and what their day to day activities could be.
<p>
</p>
It was at this stage that I found the scene becoming somewhat overwhelming. This lead me into the decision to limit the scope down to enriching one side of the scene with layers rather than filling out the entire scene.
</p><br />

Once I was happy with the core arrangement of some of the bigger meshes, I began on some of the finer details. This was both invigorating and tedious at the same time. Bring life into the scene is exciting, adding details like wells, pots, barrels and haystacks all started to bring awe and wonder to the scene. How did this get here? Makes you wonder around the scene to find an explanation, a reason as to how this world came about.
</p>
<p>
On the flip side, it can be a slow and nitpicky task. Is it believable if I place this here? The volume of assets can become cumbersome to track and I was being to get concerns of saturating the scene with the same assets.
</p>
<p>
The scene was looking really good at this point, where I think the layers from the water to the clifftop added great depth as well as provided feasibility to the scene.

Next was lighting which was particularly difficult for me in this project. Which was mostly due to there being no interesting lighting angles or shadows. I had not designed the scene with lighting in mind as I have done previously which I was noticing a lot here.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, I focused on trying to bring out the atmosphere to the scene. Making the landscape feel colder and baron was the core concepts. Convey the idea that the scene was in isolation and far away from civilisation.
</p>
<p>
I adjusted some of the hues and saturation levels in order to remove any warm tones and soften out the highlights. With shadows, I wanted to them pop more so I strengthen the contrast and added in a slight blue tone

<b>Critique</b><br /><br />
I really like the execution of the design of the static meshes, however, I think I fell down bringing the composition together with lighting. I realise now that a strong sunlight oriented scene in a snow environment is quite difficult to pull off. I needed to take lighting into more account earlier in the design process such as lighting angles or even looked into using a completely different lighting mood (late evening or night time).
<p>
</p>
In saying that, it is an open landscape scene, where lighting on its own does not carry as much weight as it does indoors. I needed to compliment the lighting with effects such as fog/steam particle systems. I do have some particle systems, where I could have greatly improved on this. More of these particle effects could have enhanced the harshness of the environment and added some character to the scene.
<p>
</p>
Some of the cliff face meshes look a bit clunky with odd flat edges. This is likely due to the scale I chose, which is out of proportion for the intended size of these assets. Or rather, the sizing is ok, just not this close up. Upscaling like this feels ok for background d√©cor.
<p>
</p>
Looking back now, this would have been a great project to have learnt how to do lighting across different time periods. Night time or sunrise/set could have been a great way to develop those skills.
</p>
<br />
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><br /><br />
I built a bigger scene with more content and expanded my game environment skills for which I am happy about. This project helped identify some of the design aspects I need to focus more on in the future. It also highlighted how difficult it is to keep cohesion across the different elements of design as the scale grows. I will expand on my planning more as a result.
</p>
<p>
I do like the scene, I am really happy with it considering I am still learning the ropes. A lot of improvements can be made, where I might re-explore this setting in the future with more experience. Especially with lighting in different settings.
